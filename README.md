# codechef
Codechef competitions happen ~ once a week, and are a fun way to keep up some coding. 

The first couple competitions are mostly just climbing the ladder, as the lowest division has a bunch of freebies, but there is at least one interesting problem in each of them.
After starter 42 I bumped up to D3, so the later competitions have more interesting problems.
